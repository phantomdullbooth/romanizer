Need today's date? No problem. Get it with roman numerals instead of arabic numbers. Why? Good question.
* example: DECEMBER XXIII, MMXIX

#### Notes
* Uses IV for 4. Isn't that the standard way of writing 4? Yes, but it's also the symbol for Jupiter, so sometimes you might see IIII instead. I like Jupiter. I like the number 4. No need IV change.
* More Roman stuff to be added later
