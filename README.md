# Date, Romanized
* app/function to get date (US format) with roman numerals in place of standard numbers
* no link. just copy code.

â€” example: DECEMBER XXIII, MMXIX

#### Notes
* Uses IV for 4. Isn't that the standard way of writing 4? Yes, but it's also the symbol for Jupiter, so sometimes you might see IIII instead. I like Jupiter. I like the number 4. No need IV change.
